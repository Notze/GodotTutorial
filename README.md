# GodotTutorial
My first project using the IDE Godot.

I started with this Tutorial from 2024:\
[How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) 
(Channel: [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys))\
But quickly went off track, looked for useful programming patterns and documented a bunch of code that is overkill for a basic first project like this but useful concepts for following projects. For example the TutorialStateMachine and the LabelFader  which are loaded as singletons by project configuration.
